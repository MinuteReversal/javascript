        //In JavaScript, null is an object. There's another value for things that don't exist, undefined. The DOM returns null for almost all cases where it fails to find some structure in the document, but in JavaScript itself undefined is the value used.
        //Second, no, there is not a direct equivalent. If you really want to check for null, do:
        if (null == yourvar); // With casting
        if (null === yourvar); // Without casting

        //If you want to check if a variable exists
        if (typeof yourvar != 'undefined'); // Any scope
        if (window['varname'] != undefined); // Global scope
        if (window['varname'] != void 0); // Old browsers

        //If you know the variable exists, but don't know if there's any value stored in it:
        if (undefined != yourvar);
        if (void 0 != yourvar); // For older browsers

        //If you want to know if a member exists independent of whether it has been assigned a value or not:
        if ('membername' in object); // With inheritance
        if (object.hasOwnProperty('membername')); // Without inheritance

        //If you want to to know whether a variable autocasts to true:
        if (variablename);
